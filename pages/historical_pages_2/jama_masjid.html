          <p>Jama Masjid
	Jama Masjid is located in one of the oldest and busiest corners of Old Delhi. The Jama Masjid is the largest and known mosque in India.
	The Jama Masjid was constructed in 1650â€“56 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, a noted patron of Islamic architecture whose most famous work is the Taj Mahal, in Agra.
	The great mosque of Old Delhi is the final architectural extravagance of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan with a courtyard capable of holding 25,000 devotees. The mosque measures 65m by 35m, and its court forms a square of 100m. Built in 1656, it is an eloquent reminder of the Mughal religious fervour.
	The Jama Masjid was regarded as a symbolic node of Islamic power across India, well into the colonial era. It was also a site of political significance. It was an iconic structure of the Islamic architecture.
	The structure is adorned with three huge arched gates, three marble domes, four towers, and two towering minarets. It also has a sprawling courtyard that can accommodate more than 25,000 people for prayers at a time. There are 130 steps inside each minaret to climb to the top.
	The nearest places to reach the Jama Masjid are Chandni Chowk (about 0.2 km), Digambar Jain Lal Mandir, Indian War Memorial Museum and The Red Fort.
