          <p>Phawngpui Tlang
Phawngpui Tlang, popularly known as “The Blue Mountain” is the highest peak in Mizoram. It is situated near the south-eastern border overlooking the bend of the mighty Chhimtuipui River and the hill ranges of Myanmar. Sangau village, which is about 229 kms from Aizawl, is the closest settlement to Phawngpui. With a height of 2157 meters at the peak, the ridge stretches nearly 10 kms in north-south direction. It is surrounded by sheer precipices and cliffs, of which Thlazuang Kham is the most spectacular one. This breezy ridge is a virtual garden of beautiful flowering trees like rhododendrons and orchids of various hues, and one can also get splendid views of blue hazed hills extending to the horizon all around.
Abounding with diverse flora and fauna, Phawngpui has been declared a National Park covering an area of about 50 sqkm. Exploring the park requires trekking and one can get the most exciting views of Mizoram from the cliffs of Phawngpui. It is famous for its exotic species of flora and fauna especially the orchids and rhododendrons spread within the valleys surrounding on all sides. Here one has a good chance of sighting gorals grazing peacefully in the steep slopes, brightly plumed sunbirds hovering over colorful flowers, peregrine falcon swooping down on fleeting cliffs or hearing in the evening the sharp calls of barking deer. Phawngpui is also home to an amazing variety of birdlife including the rare Tragopan, Dark Rumped Swift and pheasants, and endangered mammals like the Slow Loris, Tiger, Leopard, Leopard Cat, Serow, Goral, Asiatic Black Bear, Stump-tailed Macaque and Capped Langur.
