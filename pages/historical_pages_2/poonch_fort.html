          <p>POONCH FORT
Poonch Fort or Poonch Qila is considered to be one of the historically rich castles of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The architecture of the fort is hugely influenced by the Mughal style of architecture. Poonch District was a district of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, currently divided between India and Pakistan. The Pakistani part of Poonch district (now a Division) is part of the Azad Kashmir territory, whilst the Indian part of Poonch district is part of Jammu and Kashmir. The capital of the Pakistan-controlled side is Rawalakot; while the capital of the Indian side is Poonch.
The foundation of this fort was laid in AD 1713 by Raja Abdul Razaq Khan, but the construction of the same was completed by his son Raja Rustam Khan, between AD 1760 and 1787. ... At present, this fort stands as the pride of Poonch and is one of the city's main tourist attractions.
Around 850 A.D., Poonch became a sovereign state when Mr. Nar, a horse trader declared himself Raja of Poonch. In 1596 A.D. Mughal King Jehangir nominated Siraj-ud-din of village Kahuta as Raja of Poonch. In 1798 A.D. a Gujjar leader Rooh-ullah-Sangu became the ruler of this area.
