          <p>GOLCONDA FORT

INTRODUCTION:-
Golconda Fort is located in the western part of Hyderabad city and is about 9 km from the Hussain Sagar Lake. The outer fort occupies an area of three square kilometers, which is 4.8 kilometers in length.

HISTORY:-
According to popular historical beliefs, a shepherd had discovered an idol in the place where Golconda Fort rests today. Soon after this unique discovery, the matter was conveyed to Kakatiyan King, who ordered a fort of mud to be constructed around this idol.

After the construction of the structure was complete, people started recognizing it by the name “Golla Konda”, meaning Shepherd’s Hill. The fort became popular in the sixteenth century during the reign of Qutb Shahi Dynasty. Eventually the mud fortress expanded and took the shape of a huge structure manifesting an outer wall of around 10 kilometers.

Later in the year 1687, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb conquered the fort. As of now, Golconda Fort is home to a spectrum of mosques and palaces, many of which are unfortunately in ruins. The beauty and elegance of the fort is famous all over the globe.
