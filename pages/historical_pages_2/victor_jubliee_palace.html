          <p>Victor Jubilee Palace
Cooch Behar Palace, also known as the Victor Jubilee Palace, is a key attraction in the city of Cooch Behar in West Bengal. This imposing structure has an illustrious historic and cultural legacy. The value of this landmark is impossible to estimate, going by the cavernous size of the palace itself and the grounds. It would easily run into hundreds if not thousands of crores. The Cooch Behar Palace is inspired by London’s Buckingham Palace and was built in 1887 during the rule of Maharaja Nripendra Narayan of the reigning Koch Dynasty.
The Cooch Behar Palace is a double-storeyed heritage property. Built in the classical western design, it covers a whopping 51,309 sq ft. The palace measures 395 ft in length, 296 ft in width and is positioned 1.45 meters above the ground. The Cooch Behar Palace has several verandahs on the first and ground floors, with piers arranged in double and single rows, alternately.
The Cooch Behar Palace has several halls within the premises including some exquisite rooms like the Bedroom, Dressing Room, Drawing Room, Billiards Hall, Dining Hall, Toshakhana, Library, Vestibules and Ladies’ Gallery. The original structure, which was three-storeyed, was destroyed in the 1897 earthquake in neighboring Assam. The palace indicates the European idealism of the kings who ruled Cooch Behar and how they fused their rich Indian heritage with European ideals. It is, today, a monument of national importance.
The Cooch Behar Palace was originally designed by Nripendra Narayan, the Koch King. The palace is also home to a museum, where visitors can view several artworks and objects from the past. The museum has a huge collection encompassing chandeliers, oil paintings, antiques, terracotta figurines, arrows, clay models, photographs and even sandstone and laterite sculptures. A tribal gallery is also present, showcasing the everyday life of locals in Cooch Behar.
