The Hidimba temple is situated on the foothills of the Himalayas, around which there is greenery and the forest of Siddar. The history of this temple is associated with Pandavas. It is believed that Hadimba was a monstrous, whose royalty ran around the entire area around Manali. People of the Kullu dynasty worship her as goddess. During Navaratri, this temple is crowded. Hidimba Devi is worshiped in Kulluâ€™s famous Dussehra fair.
This temple was constructed in 1553 AD in a stone. The stone was cut in such a way that it came to be cave. Visitors can visit this stone and can perform special worship. It is said that after the construction of this temple, the king cut the hands of artisans who built the temple so that they could not build such a temple somewhere.
