          <p>RABDENTSE
Rabdentse Ruins is the archeological site that tells Sikkim’s story of glory. Until 1814 A.D, it was the second capital of Sikkim, established by the Chogyal II. Later on, after the Nepalese invasion in the 18th century, the palace and the monastery complex was destructed and turned into ruins. 
The place is a must see for the history-enthusiasts who want to dig into the state’s past in between the spectacular view of Kanchenjunga peak and the gushing river flowing through the foothills. The ruins of Rabdentse Palace are just a walk away from the Pemayangtse Monastery through the dense forest on the way to Pelling. As one enters the gate, the chestnut trees welcomes the visitors by dropping mosses on them and leads to the stone throne comprising of three standing stones known as ‘Namphogang’ where the judges used to pronounce the final judgement. Walking a little further, one will see ‘Taphap Chorten’ which was the entry point of the palace, while the ruins are at the centre of the fourth courtyard which offers the mesmerizing view of the southwestern region of Sikkim. Alongside this is ‘Dab Lhagang’ where the royal family used to prayer to their deities. Near to this, a white marble slab can be seen which was once the location of the monastery known as “Risum Gompa".
The ruins of the Rabdentse Palace lie in the West Sikkim, which can be reached by trekking down 2 kilometers from the Pemayangtse Monastery on the way to Pelling. Pelling is 125 Km from Gangtok. One can hire a taxi or take a share jeep from Pelling to Pemayangtse Monastery and other popular tourist attractions around it.
During the summer season from March to May, the weather is exceptionally pleasant and the temperature ranges between 7°C to 28°C, which is quite bearable to move around and explore the place.
Some of the must visit tourist places:
	Pemayangtse Monastery
