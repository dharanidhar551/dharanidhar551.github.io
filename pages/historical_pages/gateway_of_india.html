The Gate Way of India, an Arch monument, often referred to as “The Taj Mahal of India”, located in Mumbai resembles the finest art of Indian sculpture. As the name suggests it literally served as a gate-way to India for the British Viceroys. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911.
The structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 meters (85 feet) high. The structural plan of Gate way of India is designed in the Indo-Saracenic style. 

The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea.
