          <p>Ratanpur was the capital of Dakshin Kaushal now known as Chhattisgarh, a state of India. Ratanpur is situated 25 km away from the Bilaspur city of Chhattisgarh. It also lies in the national highway 200, towards Ambikapur city.
Ratanpur is famous all over India because of its magnificent fort. This magnificent fort was built on a plateau which was surrounded by ponds from all three sides along with a strategic location which had connectivity and nearby forest for army cantonment. The fort includes large walls to protect them from invaders and fencing around the fort. The architecture of the fort was simple and strategic. The fort has four grandeur entrances named as Simha, Ganesh Bhairav and Semar dwar. The walls of the fort had several carvings of sculptures including gods and goddesses. It has a huge expanse of garden, several forts, and temple.
These forts despite being colossal, stands stiff and narrate the story of apogee and the decline of a kingdom, where bloodshed was common for the throne. But we can find several anecdotes regarding ruins of this fort, some said plague hit the city and the royal family abandoned the fort or some say in search of king’s treasures thieves’ dugout the foundation of the fort because of which forts became weak and starts to turn into remnants. Whatever may be the reason but, Ratanpur adds a significant and glorious chapter to the marvellous Indian history.
