          <p>Delhi-Red Fort:
The Red Fort, which is also known as the Lal Qila, was constructed by one of the most famous Mughal emperors, Shah Jahan. Built on the banks of river Yamuna, the fortress-palace was designed by architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. It took 8 years and 10 months to build the magnificent fort. The fort served as the royal residence of the Mughal emperors from 1648 to 1857. The Red Fort derives its name from the red-sandstone walls, which make the fort almost impregnable. The fort is located at Old Delhi 
Shah Jahan, the then Mughal emperor decided to build the Red Fort as the citadel of Shahjahanabad, his new capital at Delhi. The fort, which was completely constructed in the year 1648, remained the residence of the Mughal emperors until 1857. Post the reign of Aurangzeb, the Mughal dynasty grew weaker in every aspect and that started taking a toll on the fort. When Farrukhsiyar, the ninth Mughal emperor, took over the reign from Jahandar Shah after murdering him, the fort began to lose its luster, quite literally. During his reign, the silver ceiling of the fort was replaced with copper in order to raise money. After independence, the Indian Army occupied a major part of the fort before handing it over to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASA) for restoration purposes.
The Red Fort was built by the legendary architect Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, who is believed to have built the world famous Taj Mahal.The Red Fort is spread across an area of 254.67 acres. The defensive wall, enclosing the fort, is measured at 2.41 kilometers. The walls differ in height as they stand at 18 meters on the river side as opposed to the 33 meter The fort is considered a creative structure and as the pinnacle of Mughal inventiveness. Red Fort has many structures that serve as fine examples of Islamic architectural style and Mughal architecture, which fuses the architectural styles of the Timurids and the Persians. The Red Fort is known for its gardens (most of which were destroyed by the British) and a water channel called the Stream of Paradise.
Speciality:
It is often considered as the pinnacle of Mughal creativity. In modern times, the fort is of importance to the people of India as the Indian Prime Minister delivers his Independence Day speech from the fort, every year on August 15. In 2007, it was declared as UNESCO World Heritage Site.
