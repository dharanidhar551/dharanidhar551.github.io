          <p>RANG GHAR
It is 3 km away from the center of Sivasagar Town. Situated by the side of the Assam Trunk Road, it lies to the northeast of the Rangpur Palace, a seven-storied royal complex comprising the Talatal Ghar and the Kareng Ghar.
The Rang Ghar  ( rong ghor meaning "House of Entertainment") is a two-storeyed building which once served as the royal sports-pavilion where Ahom kings and nobles were spectators at games like buffalo fights and other sports at Rupahi Pathar (pathar meaning "field" in Assamese).
Said to be one of the oldest surviving amphitheaters in Asia, the building was first constructed during the reign of Swargadeo Rudra Singha with bamboo and wood. It was later rebuilt with brick by Swargadeo Pramatta Singha in AD 1744-1750.
The entrance to the Srimanta Sankaradeva Kalakshetra at Guwahati echoes the Rang Ghar. The Rang Ghar was the logo of the 33rd National Games held in Guwahati, in February 2007.
BY AIR: Sivasagar doesnâ€™t have own airport. The nearest airport is in Rowriah Airport at Jorhat which is near about 60 km from Sivasagar town.
BY TRAIN: Sivasagar is also connected with Indian Railways Network.
BY ROAD: Sivasagar is connected to all over Assam.
