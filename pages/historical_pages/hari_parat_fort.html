Hari Parbat is also known as Kooh-e-Maran lies on the west of Dal Lake in Srinagar, in the UT of Jammu & Kashmir. This Mughal structure was built by an Afghan Governor Atta Mohammed Khan in 18th century. Later a long wall was constructed in 1590 by Emperor Akbar. Surrounded by commendable structures from all religions, this fort sits at the top giving a spectacular view of Dal Lake.
